# MarvelEngine
The 3D game engine uses OpenGL.
Development only for educational reasons.

The project starts again from scratch.

## Build
For Linux generate a solution with a makefile.
For Windows generate a solution with one of .bat-files in the directory.
Make sure that you have CMake installed.

## Libraries
The project uses some libraries. 
For Windows add pre-compiled binaries (as .dll-files) into the build folder. Headers need to put into Source\3rdParty directory.
